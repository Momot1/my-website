                            I completed high school in 2018. I graduated from Central Crossing High School, located in Grove City, OH. During High School, I always excelled more in math and science, and struggled in writing and history. It wasn't that
                            I was not fluent in english, or that it was hard for me to study history, it was that I just wasn't interested in those subjects. I have always been a visual learner, and liked hands on learning. I liked critical thinking, which
                            is why I enjoyed math so much. I took a couple programming classes during high school, and realized that being a software developer is my dream job.

                            I started out with college in a community college. I went to Columbus State. I intented to get a bachlors in computer science, and I wanted to go to community college to save a little money. I went to community college for 1 year, and
                            transfered to Ohio State University.

                        <p>
                            I was only in Ohio State for one semester. I took one semester of classes, and did not receive any type of financial aid. On top of this, most of the courses that I took at Columbus State had not transfered over to Ohio State,
                            so I would have had to redo a lot of the courses that I already did. This caused me to want to take a break from school, and when I went on break, I originally thought that I would go back after saving up some money to be able to
                            pay for school. After working in construction, I decided that pursuing a traditional degree would financially not be worth it for me, as I did not want to graduate with nearly 40 thousand in debt. This is what ultimately led me to
                            start looking into coding bootcamps.

                <h1>Career</h1>
                <p>
                    My career started out when I was just 14 years old. During high school, I worked during the summers with my father.
                    We worked for an individual who purchased homes, we would remodel them, and the owner would put them on rent. I worked 
                    with my father till I was 17. When I turned 17, I started to work for another guy who would work on hotel construction 
                    all around America. We completed tasks such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cabinet installation</li>
                    <li>Countertop installation</li>
                    <li>Shower surrounds installation</li>
                    <li>Shower door installation</li>
                    <li>Window sill installation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After a couple years on an off with this job, I ended up quiting. The reason I was on and off was because it was all out 
                    of town work, and I was still in school so I could only work at this job while I was on breaks from school. During the 
                    shool time, I still continued to work with my father part-time. Once I dropped out of school, I only worked out of town 
                    work, and the reason I quit was becuse being away from home so much was very draining. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After quitting from the hotel jobs, I started to work with my cousin doing remodel work in town again. It is basically the 
                    same type of work as with my father, just with a different boss. I worked this job for about a year, and decided to quit 
                    and go work with my other cousin. This is where I currently work at, and we do remodel houses, but we do homes that are a lot 
                    more expensive than any homes that I ever did before, so it is a nice change in scenery. 
                </p>

                    Currently, I am a software developer in search for a job. I am experienced in {placeholder}. You can check my resume to your left.
